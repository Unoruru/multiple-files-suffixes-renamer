# multiple-files-suffixes-renamer

The .exe file is used for naming large amount of files' suffixes by using .bat file.

Only adapt to the directory as follow:

A/
├── a1/  (contains .webp files)
├── a2/  (contains .webp files)
├── a3/  (contains .webp files)
...
└── aN/  (contains .webp files)
And you want to rename all .webp file under A as e.g. .jpg files at once.
