# multiple-files-suffixes-renamer

The .exe file is used for naming large amount of files' suffixes by using .bat file.

Only adapt to the directory as follow:

A-----
      |
      |-----a1 with e.g. .webp only
      |
      |-----a2 same as a1
      |
      |-----a3 same as a1
    ... ...
      |
      |-----aN same as a1
And you want to rename all .webp file under A as e.g. .jpg files at once.
